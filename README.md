This MCP Seed Repo will allow you to use AI Coding agents such as Claude Code, Gemeni CLI and OpenAI's Codex, as well as AI IDEs such as Cursor or Windsurf, to create and run ANY MCP server and toolkit you'd like to build. 

How Does It Work?
I've prepared the repo in two main sections. 
1) The MCP Management and Debug Hub
2) The Knowledgebase and tutorials for any AI to successfully build more MCP servers and toolkits.

The Repo also includes a Prompt Pack to help you with any phase of the development process.

## Claude Code  
Claude Code will produce the best result, most consistently. 
I've prepared all the hooks required for Claude Code to successfully build MCP servers and toolkits, all you need to do is ensure the prepared CLAUDE.md, and .claude folder are in the root directory, launch Claude Code, and type "Being Brainstorming".
